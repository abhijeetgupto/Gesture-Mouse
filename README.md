Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse makes human computer interaction simple by making use of Hand Gestures. The computer requires almost no direct contact. All i/o operations can be virtually controlled by using static and dynamic hand gestures. This project makes use of the state-of-art Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to recognize hand gestures, which works smoothly without any additional hardware requirements. It leverages models such as CNN implemented by [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) running on top of pybind11. pyautogui provides the ability to simulate mouse cursor and clicks. Currently it works on Windows platform.
